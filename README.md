# Embedded-Systems-Design
University of Pittsburgh ECE 0202

## Brief
Interfacing embedded processors using C and ARM Assembly. Focus on general purpose input output, interrupt service routines, and 
CPU functionality.

## Semester
Summer 2022

# Labs
## Lab 1 - Introduction
A simple program to send a message to serial output. (ARM Assembly)
## Lab 2 - GPIO and Timing
Uses memory interfacing to blink an LED on button input (C).
## Lab 3 - 7-Segment Display
Stores a 4-bit counter to display hexidecimal values on an external 7-segment display. Counter increments are triggered by button presses. (ARM Assembly)
## Lab 4 - Keypad Scanning
Takes inputs from an external keypad and prints the typed values to serial output. (ARM Assembly)
## Lab 5 - Mechatronics
Program to sequence GPIO outputs to turn a stepper motor. Also tracks the stepper motor's revolution angle (based on observations). (ARM Assembly)
## Lab 6 - Alarms
Uses low-level programming to set a system alarm and write its outputs to a MicroSD card.
